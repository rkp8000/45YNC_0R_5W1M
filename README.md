# Balanced state of neural networks with local divisive normalization

Here we explore a multi-dimensional generalization of the classic balanced state capable of producing a wide range of fluctuation-driven nonlinear dynamics and which reveals a possible functional role of irregular spiking. The network generalizes classic E-I balance to balance among several different neural populations with different tunings, with local interactions mediated through a normalization or winner-take-all nonlinearity.

If you want to play around with the spiking network or mean-field approximation, start with the demo notebooks 0A-C.
